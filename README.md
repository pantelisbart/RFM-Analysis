# RFM-Analysis
Clustering algorithms based on RFM Analysis

In this example of E-Commerce data we will try to implement Hierarchical Clustering and K-means algorithms.

The main focus of the study is to identify how many clusters exist in the dataset based on RFM Analysis.

RFM analysis is based on the Recency(R) , Frequency (F) & Monetary (M).

More specifically,

Recency is the variable which shows when was the last time a customer bought something.

Frequency is how often a customer purchase something.

Monetary is the money he spends.
